  after the Niger River. Niger is bordered by Libya to the northeast, Chad to the east,
  Nigeria to the south, Benin to the southwest, Mali to the north-west, Burkina Faso to the south-west,

  The country's predominantly Muslim population of about 22 million live mostly in clusters 
  in the far south and west of the country.
