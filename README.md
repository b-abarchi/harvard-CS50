# Homepage
 	General information
  Designed a personal webpage about one of my interests:
    the website contains four different .html pages, and it is possible to get from any page on the website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
    the website includes at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
    the website has one stylesheet file.
    the stylesheet uses five different CSS properties, and five different types of CSS selectors. it also uses the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
   the stylesheet includea  one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
    it also uses Bootstrap 4, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and uses at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrapâ€™s grid model.
    the stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
